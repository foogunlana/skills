# Future Enhancements

Ideas for future versions of Calendar Audit.

## Planned

- **Auto-decline suggestions** - For Red zone meetings, offer to draft a polite decline message
- **Calendar blocking** - After audit, suggest creating focus blocks on the calendar to protect maker time
- **Trend dashboard** - Show meeting hours over the last 4-8 weeks to visualise if meeting load is creeping up
- **Integration with Oya** - Surface meeting audit results in weekly planning notes automatically

## Ideas

- **Meeting cost calculator** - Show the dollar cost of each meeting (attendees x hourly rate x duration) to make waste visible
- **Attendee analysis** - Flag meetings where you're one of 10+ attendees (high async potential)
- **Recurring vs one-off split** - Track what % of meeting time is recurring (structural) vs one-off (reactive)
- **Energy-aware scheduling** - Consider time-of-day preferences (mornings for focus, afternoons for meetings) when suggesting batching
- **Team-wide audit** - Score meetings across a whole team, not just one person
- **Slack/email digest** - Send a weekly meeting audit summary outside of Claude Code
- **Calendar event tagging** - Add metadata to calendar events (e.g. "audited", "optimised") for tracking
